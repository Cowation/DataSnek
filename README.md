# Data Snek

That one game on your old Nokia, but better!

## Development

Install Processing 4.0b6 and ensure the folder named `processing-4.0b6` is in `Program Files`.

If you are using an operating system other than Windows or if you are using a newer version of Processing, edit the Eclipse `.classpath` or the IntelliJ IDEA `DataSnek.iml` to point to your own core Processing library jar.
